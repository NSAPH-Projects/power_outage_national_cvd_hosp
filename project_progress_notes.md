Need to clean up and add power outage data processing code to this repository, 
and then continue to work on making an analytic dataset. 

Question for Joan: are there any papers looking at rates of Medicare insurance by county among those who are eligible? Thinking about who our denominator should be, and if it should be people over 65 or the benes files already on FASSE. 

Another question: is there a way to distinguish between emergency and non-emergency admissions? Robbie says there is and that it's key. ok turns out you can. we should definitely do this!!
